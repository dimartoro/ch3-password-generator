# Javascript Password Generator

## Description

The Password Generator Website works based on five parameters. The first one is a number between 8 and 128 characters to determine the length of the password, and the other four help to determine whether the password will have lower letters, upper letters, numerical values, or special characters. The length of at least eight characters and the selection of at least one option among the type of characters asked by the dialog box is required for the program to populate the password.
